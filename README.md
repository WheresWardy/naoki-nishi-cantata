This project is an attempt at creating an accurate transcription of Naoki Nishi's jazz interpretation of Cantata BWV 147 by Bach. The original recording can be found on any Roland HP 237 digital piano as the fifth demo song (Demo+Harpsichord). I transcribed the song myself by ear, using various open source tools. For the notation, I used LilyPond. I posted the resulting PDF on my blog several years ago, which generated some interest. I received some help via email to improve the score, but there is much more work to be done. Since I have no background in music theory, I would love to get input from some experts, and perhaps music students. The goal is to make the transcription as accurate as possible. I will also be happy to consider other interpretations.

Addition of a Creative Commons license is pending. I am considering Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike. This will be finalized before I upload the actual LilyPond source. It is VERY important that no one use either the source or the final product for financial gain.

I have a WAV file of the original recording. There is no MIDI version available, unfortunately. As it would be very difficult to improve the score without having access to this file, I may consider granting limited access to it once I figure out how. It is important to note that the recording is owned by Roland Corporation.

Please, if you find this project interesting, contact me! I look forward to any comments or suggestions.
