This project is an attempt at creating an accurate transcription of Naoki
Nishi's jazz interpretation of Cantata BWV 147 by Bach. The original
recording can be found on any Roland HP 237 digital piano as the fifth
demo song (Demo+Harpsichord).  I transcribed the song myself by ear,
using various open source tools. For the notation, I used LilyPond. I
posted the resulting PDF on my blog several years ago, which generated
some interest. I received some help via email to improve the score,
but there is much more work to be done. Since I have no background in
music theory, I would love to get input from some experts, and perhaps
music students.  The goal is to make the transcription as accurate as
possible. I will also be happy to consider other interpretations.

I have a WAV file of the original recording. There is no MIDI version
available, unfortunately. As it would be very difficult to improve
the score without having access to this file, I may consider granting
limited access to it once I figure out how. It is important to note that
the recording is owned by Roland Corporation.

To compile the LilyPond source file, you obviously need to have a working
copy of LilyPond installed on your system. If you are running Linux,
I recommend the following commands to download and compile the latest
version. Note that we create a build directory to avoid cluttering
the repo.

$ git clone https://github.com/marcpayne/naoki-nishi-cantata.git
$ cd naoki-nishi-cantata
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ lilypond --include=../ ../naoki-nishi-cantata.ly

If you find this project interesting, please contact me! I look forward
to any comments or suggestions.
